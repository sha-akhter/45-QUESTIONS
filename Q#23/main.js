/*Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests.
print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each
test.
Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates
 to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
5 tests evaluate to False.*/
//MAKING A VARIABLES:
let five = 5;
let ten = 10;
//TEST:01
console.log("test 1: five is equal to 5?");
console.log(five == 5);
//TEST:02
console.log("test 2: ten is equai to 5?");
console.log(ten == 10);
//TEST:03
console.log("test 3: five is not equal to 10?");
console.log(five != 10);
//TEST:04
console.log("test 4:ten is greater than 5?");
console.log(ten > 5);
//TEST:05
console.log("test 5: five is smaller than 10?");
console.log(five < 10);
//TEST:06
console.log("test 6: ten is smaller than 5?");
