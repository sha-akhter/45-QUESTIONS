 //Question#12
 //Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just 
 //printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
 //The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
 // personalized with the person’s name.

 let friendsArr1 = ["Hina", "Bushra", "Asfa",  "Naz"]
 
  friendsArr1.forEach(friendsArr1 => console.log(`Hello ${friendsArr1}, How are you?`))

 //Question#13
 //Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a 
 //motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples.
 // Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as 
 //“I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

 let  transportationModes = ["bike", "car", "scooty", "Jeeb",  "train" ]
  transportationModes.forEach(transportationModes =>
     console.log(`i would like to own a ${transportationModes}`));
